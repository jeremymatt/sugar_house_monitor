Good morning Jeremy -

        I got to thinking about the roadside sap tank last night while waiting for the No-Doz to wear off so I could go to sleep and I realized that I made a mistake on the possible radius of the tank corners.  The 13 1/4” measurement is from the top of the board that goes along the bottom of the tank, and the board is 2 3/4” wide, so that would make the likely radius 16”.  Hope that explanation is clear.  I’ll get the measurement to the bottom of the overflow next time I’m over there.
